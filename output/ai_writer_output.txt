## The Gates of Morning: Chapter I - The Canoe Builder

Dick, perched on a coral ledge, scanned the southern horizon. Behind him, the ocean roared; before him, the tranquil lagoon of Karolin shimmered, a vast, sapphire expanse patrolled by gulls.  This forty-mile-wide coral ring, his kingdom, was a sea of tempest or a lake of tranquility, depending on the wind – and it was his, claimed just yesterday.

His people – women, children, the entire tribe – bustled along the beach: fishing, playing, mending nets.  The canoes beached on the sand, the empty houses that once held war canoes, all belonged to him now.  But as his gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, a frown creased his brow. He turned to face the relentless northern sea.  Beyond the horizon, unseen, lay Palm Tree – a paradise, yet a devil's lair.

Little Tari, Le Taioi's son, watched him. Tari, innocent of the world, knew only that war had left Karolin's women and children defenseless.  Then, yesterday, a stranger had arrived from the north, in a strange boat, with Katafa, the girl lost at sea years ago. The women called him a god-sent chief.

Tari, oblivious to the gods, asked simply, “Taori, who are you?”

Dick couldn't explain everything.  The name Dick Lestrange, his childhood, were fading memories, lost in the luminous haze of his past. His life, since the arrival of Katafa on Palm Tree, was all that remained clear.  Before that, only blurry fragments – Kearney, the old sailor who had raised him, a ghostly presence.

He looked down at Tari.  “I am Taori, little one. Why do you ask?”

“I don’t know,” Tari replied, his attention already diverted by children hauling a net.  "Ai, the fish!"

Dick's gaze returned to the north. Tari's question had stirred a memory: the schooner burned by Melanesians, his escape with Katafa, their arrival on this beach. He, the man deemed a god-sent leader.  But the memory of those escaped men tainted the beauty of the sea and sky.

They posed no immediate threat; they lacked canoes. But they would build them. They would see the lagoon's reflection in the sky, just as he had, and they would come.  The thought lingered.

Though essentially a native, the white man within Dick remained. He could plan, anticipate.  That's why he’d sent for Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, master canoe-builders. That’s why, observing the tribe, the nearly hundred youths nearing fighting age filled him with grim determination. Underlying it all, fueling his courage, was his love for Katafa – a love threatened by the unseen danger.

War canoes?  Defense or offense?  He wasn't sure yet.

A hand touched his shoulder. Katafa. A stray lock of her dark hair danced in the breeze like an eagle’s feather. Her luminous eyes, instead of meeting his, were fixed on the north.

“Look,” she breathed.

Through mirage, Palm Tree materialized – a hazy smudge, then a vivid island, breathtakingly beautiful, yet a stark reminder of their escape.  They saw the savages again, the desperate flight, the Melanesians' bloodthirsty cries. The idyllic image masked the lurking demons.

Dick's nostrils flared, his eyes darkened with hate. They had threatened him – but they had threatened *Katafa*, and that was everything.  They would come. They lacked women, and Karolin's women were tempting bait.

His world was only the ocean surrounding the two islands. No Europe, no America, just the shared history with Katafa. Yet, even in their short lives, he understood the primal instincts of men: war, plunder, destruction.

Palm Tree faded, then vanished. Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the south – the canoe bearing the canoe-builders. They left the coral and walked towards the beach, ready to meet the future.
