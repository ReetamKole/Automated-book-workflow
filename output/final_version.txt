The sapphire lagoon of Karolin shimmered, a tranquil mirror reflecting Dick's newly claimed kingdom – a forty-mile coral ring, his by conquest.  Gulls wheeled above the beach where his people bustled, a stark contrast to the thundering ocean behind him.  Empty war canoe houses stood as silent witnesses to his sudden ascension. Yet, his gaze, sweeping from the placid lagoon to the silent houses, hardened.  The northern horizon, unseen but ever-present, held Palm Tree – paradise and peril.

Little Tari, oblivious to the storm brewing in his new chief's eyes, simply asked, "Taori, who are you?"

The name Dick Lestrange felt distant, a ghost of a life before Katafa, before the burning schooner and desperate escape from Palm Tree’s savage inhabitants.  He could only answer, "Taori, little one."

Tari's innocent question stirred a painful memory: the Melanesians' blood-soaked victory, the burning ship, their harrowing flight.  He, the god-sent chief, was haunted by the past.  Palm Tree's inhabitants, lacking canoes, posed a creeping threat. But they would build them. They would come.

A white man’s mind, tempered by survival, drove him.  He’d summoned Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, master canoe builders.  The near hundred youths approaching fighting age filled him with grim determination.  His love for Katafa, a love born amidst chaos, fueled his resolve.  War canoes? Defense? Offense?  The question hung unanswered.

Katafa’s touch broke his reverie. Her gaze, locked on the shimmering horizon, betrayed the same fear.  Through the heat haze, Palm Tree materialized – a breathtaking jewel concealing a venomous heart.  The memory of their escape, of the Melanesians’ terrifying cries, flashed vividly.

Dick’s nostrils flared. They had threatened *her*. That was unforgivable.  Their lack of women meant Karolin's were tempting bait.  His world was this ocean, this shared history with Katafa.  Yet, he knew the brutal truth: the primal urge for war, plunder, destruction.

Palm Tree faded.  Then, a distant canoe appeared – Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, arriving to shape the future, a future forged in fear and love, on the knife-edge of war.  They left the coral and walked toward the beach, the fate of Karolin hanging in the balance.
