## Chapter I: Taori

The sun beat down on Dick, perched on a coral ledge overlooking Karolin’s lagoon – a forty-mile expanse of turquoise calm, ringed by coral and teeming with his newly adopted people.  Yesterday, he'd arrived from the northern sea, a stranger in a strange boat, accompanied by Katafa, a girl lost years ago.  Now, the fishermen, women, and children were his, their canoes his, their empty houses his.

But his gaze shifted from the tranquil lagoon to the canoe houses, a frown etching his brow.  Beyond the shimmering horizon, unseen but ever-present, lay Palm Tree – a paradise masked by savagery.  He remembered the island vividly.

Little Tari, Le Taioi's son, watched him.  Innocently, the child voiced the unspoken question hanging in the air: "Taori," he explained, "who are you?"

Dick couldn't tell the boy the whole truth – the story of Dick Lestrange, a child lost, raised by a sailor named Kearney on Palm Tree, escaping Melanesian raiders with Katafa.  The past was a hazy blend of memories, Kearney now a ghost, his name and the language of his childhood fading. His life truly began with Katafa on Marua.

"I am Taori," he answered, simply.

Tari, distracted by the cries of children hauling in a net, flitted away.  But the question lingered, conjuring the burning schooner, the escape in Kearney's dinghy, the terrified faces of the women and children who now saw him as a god-sent leader.

Palm Tree, now a mirage on the horizon, held both beauty and menace. The Melanesians, lacking canoes, would surely build them.  The lagoon's mirror-like reflection would guide them, just as it had guided him.  It was only a matter of time.

Dick, though essentially a savage now, possessed a strategic mind, a white man's intellect.  He'd sent for Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, master canoe builders, to prepare for the inevitable conflict.  He saw the hundred youths nearing fighting age, a force to be reckoned with. But above all, his love for Katafa burned brightest – a love threatened by the looming danger.

A hand touched his shoulder.  Katafa, a strand of dark hair escaping its vine binding, stood beside him, her eyes fixed on the north.  "Look," she whispered.

Palm Tree materialized, a spectral island rising from the sea.  The nightmare returned – the savage horde, the burning ship, the desperate escape.  They saw it all again, the horrifying beauty of their escape.

Dick's nostrils flared, hate burning in his eyes. They had threatened him, yes, but they had threatened Katafa, and that was unbearable.  The vision of Palm Tree was a prophecy.  They would come, driven by greed and desire, to claim the women of Karolin.

His world was confined to the water, to the two islands, his life intertwined with Katafa's. Yet, even within this small world, he understood the primal urge for war, the brutal history of mankind.  

Palm Tree vanished as quickly as it appeared. Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the south – the canoe carrying the builders. Leaving the ledge, they walked towards the beach, ready to face whatever the future held.
